Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. The project was sorting items and counting how many times they came up on a grocer list it was made to be a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day for input that they would need to support changing their layout a certain way.

What did you do particularly well? I think I did particulalry well in making sure all parts of the menu worked and giving the project what it was looking for.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I couldn't enhance my code in readability maybe, or just better structure, these are always helpful in efficientcy.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I found the histogram most challenging, the reasources I'm adding is any reading material supporting the code, and youtube tutorials for audio/visual learning as well.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? The skills that will be transferable is making readable code organized code and well thought out code. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? by following what the project was looking for to the best of my ability
